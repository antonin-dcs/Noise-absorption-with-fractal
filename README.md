# Noise-absorption-with-fractal
PDE-constrained topology optimization for railway noise barriers. Implements adjoint method for Helmholtz equation to compute gradients and optimizes material distribution χ(x) ∈ [0,1] balancing acoustic performance and material cost. Targets wheel-rail rolling noise (600-1100 Hz).
